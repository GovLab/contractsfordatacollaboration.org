This C4DC legal agreement library hosts clauses taken from numerous data sharing agreements. Under “List of Example Agreements”, you can view the complete list of agreements represented in the library. Under “Advanced Search”, you can view and search for individual agreement clauses. The clauses can be sorted using a variety of filters (e.g. regions, data types, intended outcomes, etc.). The library is still expanding, so you may find that certain search combinations do not match any corresponding entries. If your search returns “No Data”, then please try modifying your search criteria.

The user guide can be found [here](/static/files/190827_c4dc_user-guide_library.pdf).
