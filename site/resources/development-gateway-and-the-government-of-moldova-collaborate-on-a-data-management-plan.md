  This case study documents a data management plan (DMP) established by Development Gateway and the Government of Moldova to collect data on its development and aid programs. It is a useful example of an unsigned data sharing agreement, which can be a valuable alternative for certain data collaborations. The plan was produced through joint-collaborations and negotiations between the Government of Moldova, Development Gateway, and other data contributors. Informed by an interview with Development Gateway and the agreement text, this case study describes how the DMP was formed and highlights key elements of the agreement. The complete DMP is available in the Contracts for Data Collaboration Repository.
