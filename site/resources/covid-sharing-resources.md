  The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in new demands for data, and many countries are engaging in emergency data sharing arrangements to understand different dimensions of the health crisis. In particular, there is growing interest in the use of mobile network operator (MNO) data for tracking population movement. In response to this, SDSN TReNDS on behalf of C4DC, has gathered and analyzed example data sharing agreements (DSAs) that have been used to share MNO data for health applications to help guide other data actors considering similar arrangements.
