type: case-study
description: This case study documents a data collaboration between the Ghana
  Statistical Service (GSS), Vodafone Ghana, and Flowminder. The collaboration
  enabled the GSS to access insights from mobile phone data to plan public
  health and sustainable development policies, and it is a useful example of how
  a government and a private company were able to work with an intermediary
  partner to gain insights from sensitive data. The mobile data being used by
  the GSS as a result of the collaboration has proven especially valuable during
  the current Covid-19 pandemic to document the impact of restriction measures
  in Ghana.
