type: report
description: "With the influx of new technologies being used as a result of the
  COVID-19 pandemic, it has brought about a range of new questions around how
  data should or should not be used; intellectual property rights; limitations
  on data re-use; how long data should be used for; and ultimately what should
  happen to collected data once the pandemic is over. Building upon issues
  discussed in the C4DC report, “Laying the Foundation for Effective
  Partnerships: An Examination of Data Sharing Agreements,” this brief examines
  the potential of sunset clauses or sunset provisions to be a legally binding,
  enforceable, and accountable way of ensuring COVID-19 related data sharing
  agreements are wound down responsibly at the end of the pandemic."
