  This case study documents a successful data sharing agreement between a
  private company and an international organization dealing with global
  environmental data. Google and UN Environment signed a memoranda of
  understanding (MOU) in 2018 that formalized their collaboration around
  measures of surface water. Informed by interviews with the parties and the
  actual agreement text, this case study describes how the MOU was negotiated
  and highlights key elements from the MOU. The complete MOU can be found on the
  Contracts for Data Collaboration repository.
